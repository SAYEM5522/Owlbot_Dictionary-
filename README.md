## Task Requirements:
We’d like you to create a small application that allows the user to search a dictionary for their favorite words and store them in the browser storage so that they can be retrieved and viewed.

There are 3 major steps to this process:

⦁	To search for words, you should use the Owlbot Dictionary API (⦁	https://owlbot.info). The user should be able to type a word that they’d like to search in the dictionary and see a list of results which includes the definition, example, and image.

⦁	Upon viewing the results, the user should be able to “favorite” a word and the corresponding data should be saved to the browser storage. 

⦁	At any point, the user should be able to see a view of their favorite words along with the definition, example, and image. In this view, the user should be able to remove a word from their favorites list and also filter their favorites based on the type of word (noun, adverb, adjective, etc)

We have provided two wireframes below to help illustrate (you are NOT required to follow this design, it is provided primarily to clarify the requirements):
