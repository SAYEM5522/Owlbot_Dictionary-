## Description:
The project is a small dictionary application implemented in React. It allows users to search for words, view the definitions, examples, and images associated with the searched words. Users can mark words as favorites, and their selections are stored in the browser's local storage. Additionally, users can view a list of their favorite words, filter them by type (noun, verb, etc.), and remove words from the favorites list. The application emphasizes functionality over UI design, demonstrating the use of React components and best practices for frontend development
